// HOW TO BEFRIEND A DRAGON:


//Scenario: there is a dragon with its own castle waiting for a friend to join it in its
//luxurious and adventurous life. All you need to do to join the dragon is to organise 
//a bunch of magical flowers (every flower is numbered, no flower is ever numbered 0) in the 3 provided vases.
//For the vases to work you need to divide the flowers in:
//                                                          -odd numbered flowers
//                                                          -even numbered flowers      
//                                                          -negative numbered flowers  

//each vase will unlock something that you will need to befriend the dragon.
//Odd numbered flowers vase is to unlock the key to the castle.
//Even numbered flowers vase is to unlock the map to reach the castle.
//Negative numbered flowers vase is to achieve the magic book useful to go for adventures.



//below you have a suggestion on how you can proceed:

function divideFlowers(arrayOfBunchOfFlowers){
        let providedVase ={
            unlockKeyVase: [],
            unlockMapVase: [],
            unlockMagicBookVase: [],
        }
